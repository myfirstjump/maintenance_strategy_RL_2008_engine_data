128 Engines

1. different wear out stages and manufacturing variation
2. 3 types of operational settings.
3. Contaminated data with sensor noise.
4. 26 colummns

Objectives:
to predict the # of remaining operational cycles.



Data:

	Training:
		col_1表示引擎編號: 1 ~ 218
		col_2表示time, in cycles: Cycle 1, 2, 3, ..... 每個引擎當下的cycle
		col_3, 4, 5表示 op settings:
